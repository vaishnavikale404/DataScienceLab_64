Describe how the `check_conditions` function helps in evaluating the conditions for each rule.4. Summarize how user inputs for mood and time of day are matched against these rules to derive a specific snack recommendation.5. Mention the default recommendation provided if no specific rule matches the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Expert System Decision-Making Logic\n",
        "\n",
        "The snack recommendation expert system operates based on a set of predefined `rules` and an inference engine implemented through the `get_snack_recommendation` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Rules (`rules` variable):** The core of the system is the `rules` variable, which is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a single 'if-then' rule. For example, a rule might be structured as: `{'conditions': {'mood': 'hungry', 'time_of_day': 'morning'}, 'conclusion': 'Suggest a hearty breakfast burrito.'}`. These rules encapsulate the knowledge base of the expert system, linking specific user conditions (mood and time) to a recommended snack.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **`get_snack_recommendation` Function:** This function serves as the inference engine. When a user provides their `mood` and `time_of_day`, the function iterates through each rule in the `rules` list. For every rule, it checks if the user's input matches the conditions specified in that rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **`check_conditions` Function:** This helper function is crucial for evaluating whether a rule's conditions are met. It takes the `rule_conditions`, `user_mood`, and `user_time` as input. It checks if the `mood` condition in the rule matches the `user_mood` (case-insensitively) and similarly for `time_of_day`. If all conditions present in a rule are satisfied by the user's input, the `check_conditions` function returns `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Matching User Input to Rules:** The `get_snack_recommendation` function uses `check_conditions` to sequentially evaluate each rule. The first rule whose conditions (`mood` AND `time_of_day`) are fully met by the user's input is selected. Once a matching rule is found, its `conclusion` (the snack recommendation) is returned immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Default Recommendation:** If the system iterates through all the `rules` and none of them have conditions that fully match the user's provided `mood` and `time_of_day`, the system provides a default recommendation: \"No specific recommendation found. How about some water and a healthy snack like an apple?\". This ensures that the user always receives a response, even if their specific input combination isn't covered by the defined rules."

        "*   The expert system successfully provided snack recommendations through three user interactions, demonstrating its functionality based on user-provided mood and time of day. For instance, recommendations included \"fresh fruit or a light sandwich,\" \"a small piece of dark chocolate or a banana for energy,\" and \"a hearty breakfast burrito.\"\n",
        "*   The system includes a default recommendation (\"No specific recommendation found. How about some water and a healthy snack like an apple?\") for scenarios where no predefined rule matches the user's input.\n",
        "*   The system's decision-making logic relies on a set of 'if-then' `rules` and an inference engine (`get_snack_recommendation` function) that uses a `check_conditions` helper function to evaluate rule conditions against user input.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   To enhance the expert system, consider expanding the `rules` dataset with a wider variety of moods, times, and snack recommendations to cover more user scenarios.\n",
        "*   Explore integrating a user interface (UI) to make the interaction more intuitive and user-friendly, moving beyond command-line input.\n"
