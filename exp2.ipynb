        "\n",
        "Minimax is a decision-making algorithm, typically used in game theory and artificial intelligence, for two-player turn-based games (like Tic-Tac-Toe or Chess). It helps an AI player choose the best move possible by considering all possible moves the opponent could make.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Core Idea:**\n",
        "Imagine you're playing a game, and it's your turn. You want to make a move that leads to the best possible outcome for *you*. But your opponent is also smart and will try to make the best possible outcome for *them* (which is usually the worst for you!).\n",
        "\n",
        "Minimax works by:\n",
        "1.  **Maximizing Player (You/AI):** Tries to get the highest possible score.\n",
        "2.  **Minimizing Player (Opponent):** Tries to force the lowest possible score on you.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm explores the 'game tree' (all possible future moves and their outcomes) until it reaches an end state of the game (win, loss, or draw). It then works backward from these end states, assigning scores to each move, assuming both players play optimally.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Let's use a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game to demonstrate this!**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Our AI will be 'X' (the Maximizing player).** It wants to win.\n",
        "*   **The opponent will be 'O' (the Minimizing player).** It wants to make 'X' lose or draw.\n",
        "*   **Scores:**\n",
        "    *   +10 for 'X' win\n",
        "    *   -10 for 'O' win\n",
        "    *   0 for a draw"
